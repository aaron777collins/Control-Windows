# Control Windows By Recording Actions
This is a simple program to automate tasks on your pc.
First, you record a "sequence" of actions for the program to repeat.
Then, analyze the recorded actions and make sure it fits your needs
Finally, run the script and watch your computer automate those annoying,
repetitive tasks.

Recording Keys:
c - click
d - double-click
f - right-click
s - wait for 2 seconds
` - toggle writing mode
e - end sequence

NOTE: as a fail-safe, you can move your mouse to the top left to crash the program.
This will prevent your computer from going wild while running an action.

Enjoy!
